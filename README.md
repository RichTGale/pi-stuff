# pi-stuff

A lot is my own stuff but maybe someone will find something useful.<br /><br />
A SMALL WORD OF CAUTION:<br />
The rpi0* stuff uses a pigpio library. You need to be careful maybe what you have plugged into gpio pins that are used by programs that are executed on desktop gui start up. Just a little warning. Probably don't need to worry really. But that's just the rpio0w and rpi02w folders.<br /><br />

  Downloading the repo:<br />
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/RichTGale/pi-stuff.git --recursive
  ```

  </li>
  <li>

  You can try this for raspberry pi 5 but I wouldn't install retropi with some of the other stuff because retropi kind of takes over the pi.<br />
  The script will ask what you want to install... :<br />

  ```
  cd rpi5 ; chmod +x rpi5-setup.sh ; ./rpi5-setup.sh
  ```

  </li>
</ul>
