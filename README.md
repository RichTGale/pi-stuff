# pi-stuff

A lot is my own stuff but maybe someone will find something useful.<br />
The rpi0* stuff uses a pigpio library that you need to be carefult mayne what you have plugged into those gpio pins. Just a little warning. But that's just the rpio0w and rpi02w folders.<br /><br />

<li>
  Downloading the repo:<br />
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/RichTGale/pi-stuff.git --recursive
  ```

  You can try this for raspberry pi 5 but I wouldn't install retropi with some of the other stuff.<br />
  The script will ask what you want to install... :<br />

  ```
  cd rpi5 ; chmod +x rpi5-setup.sh ; ./rpi5-setup.sh
  ```

  </li>
</ul>
