# pi-stuff

A lot is my own stuff but maybe someone will find something useful. It was for rapbian bookworm<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>
  Downloading the repo:<br />
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/RichTGale/pi-stuff.git --recursive
  ```

  </li>
  <li>

  You can try this for raspberry pi 5. The script will ask what you want to install... :<br />

  ```
  cd rpi5 ; chmod +x rpi5-setup.sh ; ./setup-rpi5.sh
  ```

  </li>
</ul>
